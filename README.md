This repository contains a collection of C++ projects that I've worked on. Each project is contained in its own directory along with a brief description of the project and its purpose. Feel free to explore the projects that interest you!

## C++

### C++ SFML

1. **[Graphing Calculator](https://github.com/Serenity0204/Graphing-Calculator)**
   C++ SFML-based graphing calculator. This innovative tool effortlessly graphs functions and operations (e.g., +, -, *, /, ^) with respect to the variable 'x', while offering zooming, decimal value input, and error handling. The calculator utilizes Shunting Yard and   RPN algorithms for parsing user input into tokens and points, complemented by a unique random color generator for visually distinct graphs.

2. **[Black Jack](https://github.com/Serenity0204/Black-Jack-SFML)**
   A Blackjack game using C++ and SFML. This engaging project brings the classic card game to life with intuitive gameplay, sleek visuals, and dynamic interactions. Players can enjoy the thrill of Blackjack while experiencing seamless graphics and user-friendly controls.
3. **[Little File System](https://github.com/Serenity0204/Little-File-System)**
   A file system simulator crafted using C++ and SFML, offering an immersive experience in simulating common Windows file system operations. Users can seamlessly interact with the system through a terminal. A multitude of features await, including directory navigation, creation and deletion of files and folders, real-time directory tree visualization, and persistent data storage across program sessions, providing a comprehensive environment for complex file and folder manipulation.

### C++ Software 

4. **[Simple KV Storage](https://github.com/Serenity0204/Simple-KV-Storage)**
   A Fast and Persistent Header Files Only Key-Value Storage that's built on top of bitcask, it supports template keys and template values. The code only consists of header files hence it's easy to integrate into other projects.

5. **[SQL](https://github.com/Serenity0204/SQL)**
   A relational database system built using C++, complete with a custom SQL-like language, from the ground up. This project involved creating essential data structures, with the exception of utilizing pre-existing std::set and std::vector functionalities. The system offers dual modes of interaction: a user-friendly command-line mode and a batch mode capable of reading from files and delivering outputs to either the terminal or files. The implemented SQL-like statements encompass crucial functionalities such as select, insert, and create operations.

6. **[Little Test Framework (LTF)](https://github.com/Serenity0204/Little-Test-Framework)**
   Little Test Framework(LTF), is a hassle-free, light weight(617 lines of code ONLY) C++ unit testing framework. Designed to make your testing experience efficient and effective, this framework provides a minimalistic approach while maintaining powerful testing capabilities.
7. **[DSA](https://github.com/Serenity0204/DSA)**
   A collection of various data structures implemented in C++ in generic forms. This project showcases my understanding of data structures and their implementations.
