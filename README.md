# My C++ Projects

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects that I've worked on. Each project is contained in its own directory along with a brief description of the project and its purpose. Feel free to explore the projects that interest you!

## Project List

### C++ SFML

1. **[Graphing Calculator](https://github.com/Serenity0204/Graphing-Calculator)**
   C++ SFML-based graphing calculator. This innovative tool effortlessly graphs functions and operations (e.g., +, -, *, /, ^) with respect to the variable 'x', while offering zooming, decimal value input, and error handling. The calculator utilizes Shunting Yard and   RPN algorithms for parsing user input into tokens and points, complemented by a unique random color generator for visually distinct graphs.

2. **[Black Jack](https://github.com/Serenity0204/Black-Jack-SFML)**
   A Blackjack game using C++ and SFML. This engaging project brings the classic card game to life with intuitive gameplay, sleek visuals, and dynamic interactions. Players can enjoy the thrill of Blackjack while experiencing seamless graphics and user-friendly controls.
3. **[Little File System](https://github.com/Serenity0204/Little-File-System)**
   A file system simulator crafted using C++ and SFML, offering an immersive experience in simulating common Windows file system operations. Users can seamlessly interact with the system through a terminal. A multitudeof features await, including directory navigation, creation and deletion of files and folders, real-time directory tree visualization, and persistent data storage across program sessions, providing a comprehensive environment for complex file and folder manipulation.

### C++ Software 

5. **[Image Processing Tool](/image-processing-tool)**
   An image processing application that can apply filters like grayscale, blur, and edge detection to images. It allowed me to dive into more advanced C++ concepts, including working with external libraries.

6. **[Online Shopping System](/online-shopping-system)**
   A command-line based online shopping system with features for browsing products, adding them to the cart, and checking out. This project demonstrates my skills in designing user interactions and managing data flow.

7. **[Chat Application](/chat-application)**
   A basic client-server chat application where multiple clients can connect to a server and exchange messages. This project introduced me to sockets programming and network communication using C++.

8. **[Data Structures Algorithms](/data-structures-algorithms)**
   A collection of various data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues) and algorithms (sorting, searching) implemented in C++. This project showcases my understanding of fundamental algorithms and their implementations.
